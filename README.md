Here's a list of all my go to libraries for data visualization and analysis as a data-noob

## Data analysis
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - I use Numpy for all my basic array manipulations. I sometimes find myself using numpy to manipulate images.
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - I use pandas for all data manipulations that are multi-columned tables. Very easy to filter and build pipelines.

## Visualisation
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
